# Air Travel Delay Study (Module 3 Final Project)

For: Federal Bureau of Transportation

By: Jen Wadkins


## Introduction

> The Federal Bureau of Transportation has requested a report on if flight delay can be anticipated with their current collection metrics, with a goal of providing proper resources to individual carriers to assist in their reduction of delays.

## Questions

* q1?
* q2?
* q3?
* q4?

## Methodology - OSEMN

### Obtaining the Data
* Source data from Bureau of Transportation and National Centers for Environmental Information
### Scrubbing/Cleaning the Data
* Clean and prepare data for model processing
### Exploring/Visualizing the Data
### Modeling the Data
* Process data with a variety of models to find the most effective model
* Provide a "realtor simulator" model to compare with machine learning model
* Demonstrate ability of model to make new predictions
### Interpreting the Data
