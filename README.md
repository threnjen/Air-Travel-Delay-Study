# Air Travel Delay Study (Module 3 Final Project)

For: Frontier Airlines

By: Jen Wadkins


## Introduction

>As the airline with the highest proportion of flight delays, Frontier Airlines has asked me to study the reasons behind flight delay, and determine what if any actions the company can take to reduce their delay impact.

## Questions

* q1?
* q2?
* q3?
* q4?

## Methodology - OSEMN

### Obtaining the Data
* Source data from Bureau of Transportation and National Weather Center
### Scrubbing/Cleaning the Data
* Clean and prepare data for model processing
### Exploring/Visualizing the Data
### Modeling the Data
* Process data with a variety of models to find the most effective model
* Provide a "realtor simulator" model to compare with machine learning model
* Demonstrate ability of model to make new predictions
### Interpreting the Data
